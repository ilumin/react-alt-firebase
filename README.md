# Babel preset
In tutorial use the old version Babel (v5), so in .babelrc they use deprecate
option `stage: 0` (see package config in: [https://github.com/hendrikswan/react-stack/blob/master/package.json])
for new version of Babel (v6), we need to install presets: react, es2015, stage-0 by
```
npm i babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-0 --save-dev
```
and set .babelrc to
```
{
  "presets": ["react", "es2015", "stage-0"]
}
```

# React hot loader
to run server use webpack-dev-server by `npm i -g webpack-dev-server`
React-hot-loader is very impressive, it's just change only updated data
but not update state or customize attribute we do in devtool
